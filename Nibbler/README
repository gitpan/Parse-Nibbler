Parse::Nibbler is a  parser that allows you to write grammars in pure perl.

It is a parser designed to parse HUGE files, a little bit at a time.
Basically, it nibbles at a file while it parses.

Grammars are written in pure perl using subroutines defined
in the Parse::Nibbler package. 


installation instructions are:
gunzip (tarball).tar.gz
tar -xf (tarball).tar
cd Parse
cd Nibbler
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install


After you've done the install, you can cd into the 
t/ subdirectory and take a look at the test examples.

The main documentation is POD at the end of the 
Parse::Nibbler.pm file itself.

Contained in the t/ subdirectory is a grammar for
parsing gate level verilog netlists, VerilogGrammar.pm.
The test t/big_verilog.t runs a benchmarking test which
times how long it takes to parse a large piece of verilog
gate level code. 6000 lines of verilog in test file. 

It currently benchmarks at about 1025 lines per second.
(on a Pentium 3 @ 750 Mhz)

Current state of package: Alpha

Any of the interfaces to the package may change at 
the next version.
